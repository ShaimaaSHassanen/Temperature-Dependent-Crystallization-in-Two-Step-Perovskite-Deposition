Here is a comprehensive `README.md` file to include in your repository. It documents the project structure, how to run the code locally, and how to access the results generated by GitHub Actions.

# Perovskite Crystallization Analysis Pipeline

This project analyzes Perovskite solar cell efficiency based on deposition methods (1-Step vs. 2-Step). It transforms an exploratory Jupyter Notebook into a production-ready Python pipeline that cleans data, trains **Decision Tree Regressors**, and generates performance visualizations automatically.

## 📂 Project Structure

| File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `data_management.py` | Handles loading the Excel dataset, cleaning outliers (PCE > 27), and splitting data into **1-Step** and **2-Step** deposition subsets. |
| `model_training.py` | Contains the `ModelTrainer` class which wraps a **Decision Tree Regressor**. Handles training, evaluation (R² & MSE), and saving the model to `.pkl`. |
| `visualization.py` | Generates plots for model performance (Actual vs. Predicted) and feature importance, saving them as `.png` files. |
| `main.py` | The entry point. It orchestrates the pipeline: loads data, runs separate experiments for 1-step and 2-step data, and saves all artifacts. |
| `requirements.txt` | List of Python dependencies required to run the project. |
| `.github/workflows/` | Configuration to run this pipeline automatically on GitHub. |

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed. It is recommended to use a virtual environment.

### 2. Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install the necessary libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, etc.):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### 3. Place Your Data

Ensure your dataset file (`Perovskite_FAIR_database_ORIGINAL_all_data.xlsx`) is in the root directory of this project.

### 4. Execute the Pipeline

Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py

```

## ☁️ How to Run on GitHub (No Local Installation)

This repository is configured with **GitHub Actions** to run the analysis in the cloud.

1. **Push** your code (and the Excel data file if it's small enough, or host it externally) to the `main` branch.
2. Navigate to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository.
3. Click on the **"Run ML Pipeline"** workflow on the left sidebar.
4. Wait for the job to finish (Green Checkmark ✅).
5. Click on the specific run, then scroll down to the **Artifacts** section.
6. Download **`experiment-results`**. This ZIP file contains:
* Trained Models (`model_1_step.pkl`, `model_2_step.pkl`)
* Prediction Plots (`1_step_predictions.png`, etc.)
* Feature Importance Charts



## 📊 Outputs

After running the pipeline, the following files will be generated:

* **Models**: `model_1_step.pkl`, `model_2_step.pkl` (Saved using Joblib)
* **Figures**:
* `1_step_predictions.png`: Visualizes how well the model predicts PCE for 1-step deposition.
* `2_step_predictions.png`: Visualizes predictions for 2-step deposition.
* `*_feature_importance.png`: Bar charts showing which chemical/process features impacted efficiency the most.



## 🛠 Model Details

* **Algorithm**: Decision Tree Regressor
* **Splitting Strategy**: The pipeline automatically detects `Perovskite_deposition_number_of_deposition_steps` and trains two separate models to account for different crystallization kinetics.
* **Filtering**: Outliers with `JV_reverse_scan_PCE > 27` are removed before training.
